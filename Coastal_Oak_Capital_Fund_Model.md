## DETAILED WORKSHEET DOCUMENTATION

### Sheet 3: Individual Asset Models

**Data Center Conversion Example (Century City Portfolio)**:

**Input Assumptions**:
- Acquisition Price: $36,000,000 (note purchase at 55% discount)

- Total Investment: $76,000,000
- Target Capacity: 15-20 MW across 10 buildings (200,000 SF total)

**Revenue Calculations**:
```
Annual Revenue = (Capacity in MW × 1000) × Monthly Rate × 12 months × Occupancy %
Base Case: (17.5 MW × 1000) × $200/kW-month × 12 × 85% = $35,700,000

Additional Services Revenue:
- Interconnection fees: $150,000/year per tenant × 8 tenants = $1,200,000
- Power management services: $50/kW-year × 17,500 kW = $875,000
- Security and monitoring: $25,000/month × 12 = $300,000
- Total Additional: $2,375,000

Total Gross Revenue: $38,075,000
Less: Sales allowances (5%): $1,904,000
Net Revenue: $36,171,000
```

**Operating Expense Model**:
```
Power Costs: $0.12/kWh × 17.5 MW × 8760 hours × 75% utilization = $11,368,800
Cooling Costs: $2.50/SF × 200,000 SF = $500,000
Security: $180,000/year (24/7 monitoring)
Maintenance: $1.50/SF × 200,000 SF = $300,000
Insurance: $0.80/SF × 200,000 SF = $160,000
Property Management: 4% of gross revenue = $1,443,000
Property Taxes: 1.2% of assessed value ($65M) = $780,000
Total Operating Expenses: $14,731,800

Net Operating Income: $21,439,200
Yield on Cost: 28.2%
```

**Revenue Model**:
```
EV Charging Revenue:
- Average session: 45 kWh
- Pricing: $0.49/kWh (includes $0.18 electricity cost + $0.31 markup)
- Daily sessions per charger: 8.5 (verified against LA market data)
- Annual sessions: 36 chargers × 8.5 sessions/day × 365 days = 112,230 sessions
- Annual kWh delivered: 112,230 × 45 kWh = 5,050,350 kWh
- Gross Charging Revenue: 5,050,350 × $0.49 = $2,474,672

Less: Electricity Costs: 5,050,350 × $0.18 = $909,063
Net Charging Revenue: $1,565,609

Additional Revenue Streams:
- Retail/Café (net): $185,000
- Advertising revenue: $180,000 (verified against comparable urban sites)

```

### Sheet 5: Financing & Capital Structure

**Debt Sizing Model**:
```
Permanent Financing Assumptions:
- Target LTV: 65% of stabilized value
- Interest Rate: 6.25% (30-year amortization, 7-year term)
- DSCR Minimum: 1.35x (conservative vs typical 1.25x)
- Recourse: Non-recourse with standard carve-outs

Example - Data Center Portfolio:
Stabilized NOI: $21,439,200
Required DSCR: 1.35x
Maximum Debt Service: $21,439,200 ÷ 1.35 = $15,880,889
Maximum Loan Amount: $15,880,889 ÷ 0.0716 (6.25% + amortization) = $221,795,000

Actual Loan Amount: Min($221,795,000, 65% × $340,000,000 stabilized value)
= Min($221,795,000, $221,000,000) = $221,000,000

Equity Return from Refinancing: $221,000,000 - $145,000,000 original debt = $76,000,000
```
