## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Coastal Oak Capital, LLC is raising $50-75 million in equity commitments for Opportunity Fund I, a high-conviction, cycle-aware investment vehicle targeting undervalued commercial real estate assets tied to distressed credit throughout Los Angeles County and select Southern California infill submarkets. We operate at the epicenter of a singular market moment where the forced devaluation of obsolete real estate converges with the exponential acceleration of AI-driven infrastructure demand.

**Fund Overview**: Our strategy targets assets meeting at least one distress criterion: at risk of default (imminent loan maturity or covenant breach), in active default (non-performing loans), in special servicing, or post-foreclosure REO properties. We acquire below intrinsic value and reposition into next-generation infrastructure uses including modular edge data centers, high-throughput EV supercharging hubs, electrification-ready industrial sites, and urban infill "power nodes."

**Strategic Edge**: We intentionally operate in a strategic "middle market" lane underserved by institutional capital – transactions too nuanced for high-volume allocators, yet with economically viable assets lacking obvious buyers. Our edge comes from buying below institutional radar, assembling operational scale across multiple small sites, and applying a "power-first" underwriting model rather than traditional real estate rent-per-square-foot approaches.

**Timing & Deployment**: While raising capital now, deployment begins late 2026/early 2027, aligning with our forecasted capitulation phase when ~$290 billion in office loans mature by end of 2027 and refinancing failures peak. By securing committed capital in advance, we position to "strike when the market is disoriented" and liquidity is scarce.

**Target Returns**: We target net returns in the mid-teens or higher (with 8% preferred return hurdle for LPs), primarily through current cash yields and equity upsides from refinancings rather than quick flips. Fund employs innovative 50/50 profit split above 8% hurdle, ensuring GP only wins when LPs win big.

**Key Investment Highlights**:
- **Cycle Timing**: Enter at true bottom when forced sellers dominate
- **Unique Strategy**: Infrastructure play leveraging power and grid constraints
- **Downside Protection**: Acquiring at 30-40% below peak values provides principal protection
- **Upside Drivers**: Repositioning for AI, EV, and energy uses unlocks outsized rents measured in $/kW
- **Alignment**: Significant GP co-invest and performance-heavy structure

Coastal Oak's mission is to power the next decade's digital and clean energy infrastructure by opportunistically converting today's distressed real estate into tomorrow's critical power and data nodes. We acquire urban megawatts, not just real estate.

## MARKET DISLOCATION DEEP-DIVE

### The Most Engineered Real Estate Collapse of the Modern Era

**COVID-Era Debt Origination**: Between mid-2020 and late 2022, enormous volumes of CRE loans were originated under historically accommodative conditions: ultra-low rates, abundant liquidity, and beliefs that post-COVID fundamentals would quickly rebound. Lenders offered interest-only periods and short 3-5 year maturities, sizing loans off pro forma incomes that never materialized.

**Current Market Distress** (Verified August 2025):
- **Office Vacancy**: National office vacancy hit 19.4% as of June 2025, up 130 basis points year-over-year¹
- **Loan Maturities**: $290 billion in office loans—one-third of the entire market—mature by end of 2027²
- **Bank Stress**: Office loans in special servicing increased 45% since early 2024, reaching $20.39 billion³
- **Delinquencies**: Commercial property delinquencies rose across all capital sources in Q1 2025⁴

**Rate Reset Impact**: The Fed's fastest tightening cycle in 40 years (0% to over 5% in 18 months) caused borrowing costs to skyrocket while property values plummeted. Nearly all 2020-2022 vintage loans face negative leverage at refinance, with many having no viable refinance path.

**Los Angeles Specifics**: Downtown LA office vacancy surged past 24%, with values down 40-60% from 2019 levels. LA has one of the country's highest concentrations of at-risk office loans, meaning numerous distressed assets and loans will be available for acquisition.

**Regulatory Forbearance**: Banks have been "extend-and-pretend" rather than rapid foreclosure, but this delays rather than solves the problem. We anticipate a catalytic moment in late 2026 when critical mass moves from denial to action, setting new pricing benchmarks that force widespread mark-downs.

## INVESTMENT THESIS & VALUE CREATION LOOP

### "When the Grid Fails to Keep Up with the Code"

**Core Thesis**: We are not "investing in real estate" in the traditional sense. We are acquiring access to urban megawatts and fiber connectivity – the throughput that will determine who controls the next decade of AI, mobility, and electrification. Our thesis centers on the belief that location-specific infrastructure (power, grid access, entitlements) will trump traditional real estate metrics in value creation.

**Megatrends We Exploit**:

1. **AI Infrastructure Supercycle**: Global data center capacity projected to triple by 2030 (60 GW to 170+ GW), largely driven by AI workloads. In LA specifically, data center power capacity estimated at 173.14 MW in 2025, projected to reach 215.76 MW by 2030 (4.5% CAGR)⁵. California developers face 18-36 month interconnection delays as grid upgrades lag demand.

2. **Urban Power Bottleneck**: LA needs 21,000+ public EV chargers and 10+ GW increase in electric load by 2030. California installed 178,000+ EV chargers as of March 2025, exceeding gasoline nozzles statewide⁶. The bottleneck isn't capital – it's access to power and permits.

3. **CRE Credit Collapse**: $1.5 trillion in U.S. CRE loans mature by 2026, with ~$375 billion facing significant refinancing challenges. This wave creates acquisition opportunities at land value or below.

**Value Creation Methodology**:
- **Discount Acquisition**: Target 40-50% discount to replacement cost (typically 40-50% of total return)
- **Physical Repositioning**: Infrastructure improvements and adaptive reuse (25-35% of return)
- **Operational Optimization**: Market timing and cash flow enhancement (15-25% of return)

**Our Response Strategy**:
- Raise capital during current "recognition" phase before pricing capitulates
- Deploy when forced sellers outnumber buyers (late 2026/early 2027)
- Acquire distressed notes, NPLs, and REO properties off-market
- Reposition for power-centric uses through phased development
- Monetize through dual approach: traditional rent per SF and revenue per kilowatt
