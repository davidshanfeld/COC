## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Singular Market Moment

Coastal Oak Capital operates at the epicenter of a collision between two massive forces: the most aggressive commercial real estate credit unwind in over a generation, and the exponential acceleration of AI-driven infrastructure demand that is outgrowing our physical grid capacity in real time.

This is not merely a cycle. It is a collision.

We acquire distressed commercial real estate assets for conversion into critical digital infrastructure: modular edge data centers, high-throughput EV charging networks, and electrification-ready industrial parcels. Our edge comes from buying below institutional radar, assembling operational scale, and applying a power-first underwriting model rather than a rent-per-square-foot paradigm.

### Investment Thesis: Infrastructure Realism

We are not speculators. We are infrastructure realists.

We underwrite power, connectivity, and regulatory efficiency—not square footage. We specialize in identifying overlooked assets whose highest and best use is invisible to the general market but visible to those who understand zoning overlays, interconnect timelines, and megawatt lease curves.

The properties we target are not "broken"—they are misunderstood, underutilized, or mispriced. We extract asymmetric value by buying intelligently, repositioning strategically, and aggregating with discipline.

### Fund Structure and Terms

**Figure 1: Fund Structure Overview**

| **Metric** | **Target** |
|------------|------------|
| **Equity Raise** | $50-75 million |
| **Gross IRR Target** | 20-25% |
| **Net IRR to LPs** | 17-22% |
| **Equity Multiple** | 2.0x-2.5x over 5-7 years |
| **Preferred Return** | 8% annually, cumulative |
| **Carried Interest** | 50% GP / 50% LP split above 8% hurdle |
| **Management Fee** | 2.0% commitment period, 1.5% thereafter |
| **Fund Term** | 10 years (with extensions) |
| **Minimum Investment** | $100,000 |

*Source: Coastal Oak Capital Fund Terms*

### Strategic Positioning

We intentionally operate in a strategic lane underserved by institutional capital:

- Transactions too nuanced or operationally bespoke for high-volume allocators
- Asset profiles that are economically viable but structurally complex  
- Parcels that, while unremarkable in isolation, form scalable infrastructure networks in aggregate

We don't compete with $5B private equity funds. We serve a different tier of opportunity—one they cannot pursue at scale and wouldn't know how to operationalize if they could.

## II. MARKET OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS

### The AI Infrastructure Supercycle

AI demand is not growing—it is exploding. The compute intensity of training modern AI models has grown over 5,000× since 2020, and that pace continues to accelerate¹. Industry estimates project global data center capacity to more than triple by 2030, rising from ~60 GW to over 170 GW, with a large portion tied directly to AI-specific workloads².

**Figure 2: Global Data Center Capacity Projection**

```
2023: 60 GW
2025: 95 GW (+58%)
2027: 130 GW (+37%)
2030: 170+ GW (+31%)

Source: Juniper Networks Global AI Infrastructure Forecast, March 2025
```

Yet demand is running far ahead of infrastructure. The North American data center market expanded by 24.4% in 2024 alone, and power constraints—not capital—are now the limiting factor³. In California, developers are facing interconnect delays of 18-36 months just to bring new MWs online⁴.

There is no centralized grid strategy to accommodate this growth. That makes real estate with pre-installed power, fast-track zoning, and fiber adjacency the next scarce resource. That is what we are buying.

### The CRE Credit Collapse That's Just Beginning

During COVID, from 2020 to 2022, banks originated commercial loans under highly accommodating terms:

- Interest-only periods
- 3-5 year maturities  
- Elevated valuations based on 2019 peak comparables
- Forward-looking NOI assumptions tied to speculative recovery curves

Nearly $1.5 trillion in CRE debt will mature before year-end 2026⁵. Of that, over $375 billion is considered refinance-impaired under current rates and value resets⁶.

**Figure 3: Commercial Real Estate Distress Indicators**

| **Metric** | **Current Level** | **Historical Context** |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **National Office Vacancy** | 19.7% Q1 2025⁷ | All-time high |
| **LA CBD Office Vacancy** | 24%+ | Values down 40%+ from 2019⁸ |
| **CMBS Office Delinquencies** | 10.9% Q2 2025⁹ | Highest since 2012 |
| **CRE Bank Delinquencies** | 1.57%¹⁰ | 10-year high |

*Sources: CoStar, Real Capital Analytics, Wells Fargo CMBS Index, FDIC*

This is not a demand problem—it is a capital structure collapse. The cost of refinancing has doubled, valuations have cratered, and NOI cannot support debt service under any rational model.

### The Urban Power Bottleneck

The grid was not built for AI inference clusters, electrified drayage fleets, or urban supercharging depots. Yet every major metro is simultaneously being tasked with supporting:

- 100% zero-emission vehicle mandates by 2035¹¹
- Electrification of logistics corridors and intermodal hubs
- Clean energy codes for new commercial redevelopment  
- AI workloads that draw 3× more power per rack than traditional servers¹²

The Los Angeles area alone will need over 21,000 public Level 2 chargers and 3,900 fast chargers by 2030, while also navigating a 10+ GW increase in projected load tied to AI compute, EVs, and building electrification¹³.

Properties with existing power infrastructure—particularly those on urban substations or already zoned for industrial use—are now infrastructure control points.

---

## III. FUND STRATEGY & DIFFERENTIATION

### Dual Revenue Framework: Square Footage and Megawatts

Coastal Oak Capital evaluates asset performance using two complementary revenue frameworks:

1. **$/SF (square foot)** – the legacy standard for institutional comparability, valuation, and exit underwriting
2. **$/MW-month (megawatt per month)** – the modern framework that reflects actual monetization capacity of energy-intensive infrastructure assets

While rent per square foot remains relevant for underwriting consistency, the true drivers of revenue for modern tenants—whether AI compute clusters, EV fleet operators, or electrified logistics platforms—are based on power draw, reliability, and interconnect capacity. These users lease throughput, not layout.

**Figure 4: Power Revenue Conversion Framework**

| **Unit** | **Energy Equivalent** | **Revenue Example** | **$/SF Equivalent** |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **1 MW** | 1,000 kW; powers ~4,000 SF data hall | $150-200/MW-month → $1.8-2.4M/year | $37.50-50/SF-month |
| **5 MW** | Mid-size AI cluster or fleet depot | $750K-1M/month → $9-12M/year | N/A - Power-based pricing |
| **10 MW** | Full-scale compute/logistics deployment | $1.5-2M/month → $18-24M/year | N/A - Power-based pricing |

*Source: Coastal Oak Capital underwriting models, market comparables*

### Target Asset Characteristics

We acquire distressed or lender-controlled commercial properties with embedded infrastructure value, defined by three core traits:

1. **Location in high-density, grid-accessible urban corridors**
2. **Structural integrity and build-to-suit flexibility**  
3. **Zoning permissibility and entitlement speed**

**Primary Geographic Focus:**
- Los Angeles urban core: Downtown LA, Koreatown, Mid-Wilshire, West Adams, Century City to Santa Monica
- Secondary markets: San Gabriel Valley, Vernon, and the 210 corridor

**Building Types & Size:**
- Class B/C office, 20,000-50,000 SF, built 1960s-1980s
- Structural Type I or III, supporting floor loads of 150-200 lb/ft² with no major retrofit required¹⁴
- Legacy retail pads with surface parking, alley access, and 3-phase power nearby
- Light industrial/flex buildings with 14-20 ft clear heights and oversized yards

### Modular Strategy: "Swarm Not Whale"

Rather than pursuing large, centralized campuses, we execute a distributed asset acquisition model:

- Acquire 10-20 small-footprint sites (20K-50K SF each) across a tight metro radius
- Retrofit each site for 3-5 MW of data center load, or for 8-12 EV dispensers
- Create a decentralized, resilient energy and compute grid, interconnected by shared infrastructure

**Benefits include:**
- Faster entitlements (by-right, small scope, non-EIR)
- Easier community acceptance—avoids NIMBY resistance
- Lower upfront capex per site—deploy capital over time, phase by phase
- Supports build-to-suit tenanting, allowing demand-side alignment before shell delivery

## IV. INVESTMENT PROCESS & UNDERWRITING

### Six-Factor Feasibility Screen

All assets undergo rigorous screening before we engage any capital:

**Figure 5: Asset Feasibility Matrix**

| **Factor** | **Requirement** | **Rejection Threshold** |
|------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Structural Load Capacity** | ≥150-200 lb/ft² | Retrofit required |
| **Grid Accessibility** | Within 1-3 blocks of transformer/substation | >3 blocks |
| **Zoning Compatibility** | C or M zone with by-right entitlement | Discretionary review required |
| **CEQA Class 32 Eligibility** | Infill exemption qualified¹⁵ | EIR/MND triggers |
| **Site Geometry & Access** | Min 60 ft width, 120 ft+ depth | Inadequate truck access |
| **PDPP Ready** | Parallel Design-Permitting Process qualified | Standard permitting only |

*Source: Coastal Oak Capital Investment Committee protocols*

Assets failing more than one category are rejected, regardless of pricing.

### Underwriting Framework

Our underwriting reflects the realities of repositioning real estate into grid-connected infrastructure, structured around three interlocking evaluations:

**1. Power Monetization Forecast**

Each asset is modeled as a power-forward lease platform, with revenue tied to:
- $/MW-month (data center) or $/dispenser-month (EV infrastructure)
- Grid interconnect upgrades, transformer tie-ins, and peak-load arbitrage opportunities
- Eligibility for demand-response revenue, LCFS credits, or battery offset programs

**2. Tenant Credit Tiering**

Discount rates are calibrated based on end-user credit quality:

**Figure 6: Tenant Credit Analysis**

| **Tier** | **Description** | **IRR Hurdle** | **Terminal Cap** |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Investment-grade tenants (AWS, Electrify America, USPS) | 6-8% | 4.5-5.5% |
| **Tier 2** | Mid-market logistics/edge compute operators | 8-10% | 6-6.5% |
| **Tier 3** | Non-credit tenants, short-term licenses | 10-14% | No terminal assumed |

*Source: Data center REIT comparables, infrastructure lease benchmarks*

**3. Exit Scenario Planning**

Each asset is modeled for disposition via:
- Sale to infrastructure REIT (CoreSite, Iron Mountain, Prologis EV)
- Refinancing upon lease stabilization with infrastructure-aligned metrics
- Strategic exit via roll-up or sale to sovereign/digital infra funds
- Portfolio sale to institutional buyers seeking urban infill exposure

## V. PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION

### Capital Deployment Strategy

**Target Portfolio Composition:**

**Figure 7: Portfolio Allocation Framework**

| **Asset Type** | **% of Equity** | **Rationale** |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Modular Data Centers** | 45-55% | Core competency, highest margins |
| **EV Charging Networks** | 25-30% | Policy tailwinds, essential infrastructure |
| **Industrial/Flex Conversion** | 15-20% | Diversification, lower execution risk |
| **Opportunistic/Other** | 5-10% | Market-driven opportunities |

*Source: Coastal Oak Capital Investment Strategy*

### Capital Stack Architecture

**Figure 8: Typical Deal Capital Structure**

| **Capital Layer** | **Source** | **% of Cost** | **Structure** |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Senior Debt** | Regional banks, mission lenders | 30-40% | LTC basis, DSCR ≥1.50x |
| **Public Capital** | DOE LPO, CEC, LADWP grants | 15-25% | Non-dilutive infrastructure funding |
| **Fund Equity** | Limited Partners | 40-50% | Primary capital source |
| **GP Co-Investment** | Coastal Oak Capital | 5% minimum | Alignment with LPs |

*LTC = Loan-to-Cost; DSCR = Debt Service Coverage Ratio*

### Risk Management Through Diversification

**Geographic Diversification:**
- Maximum 30% of assets in any single submarket
- Core LA focus with selective expansion to adjacent markets
- Proximity clustering for operational synergies while avoiding concentration

**Tenant Diversification:**
- No single tenant >20% of portfolio NOI
- Mix of credit and non-credit tenants across use types
- Long-term contracts with credit tenants, shorter flexible terms with emerging operators

**Vintage Diversification:**
- Phased capital deployment over 18-24 month investment period
- Avoid simultaneous exposure to construction/lease-up risk across portfolio
- Stagger exit timing to optimize market conditions

### Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis

**Base Case Assumptions:**
- 15% acquisition discount to market value
- 18-month average stabilization period
- 90% stabilized occupancy across portfolio
- 3% annual rent escalations

**Downside Scenario:**
- 25% construction cost overruns
- 24-month stabilization period
- 75% stabilized occupancy
- Flat rent growth, 5% annual expense inflation

**Upside Scenario:**
- 25% acquisition discount capture
- 12-month stabilization via pre-leasing
- 95% occupancy with premium rents
- Public incentive layer adds 200-300 bps to returns

**Figure 9: Scenario Analysis Results**

| **Scenario** | **Net IRR Range** | **Equity Multiple** | **Probability** |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Downside** | 12-15% | 1.6-1.9x | 20% |
| **Base Case** | 17-22% | 2.0-2.5x | 60% |
| **Upside** | 24-28% | 2.7-3.2x | 20% |

*Sources: Preqin, Cambridge Associates, internal analysis*

### Public Market Comparisons

**Data Center REITs Performance (5-Year):**
- Digital Realty Trust (DLR): 13.2% annualized total return
- Equinix (EQIX): 16.8% annualized total return
- CyrusOne (acquired by KKR/GIP at 15x EBITDA multiple)

**Industrial/Logistics REITs:**
- Prologis (PLD): 14.5% annualized total return
- EXR/AMH (specialized infrastructure): 12-18% range

Our targeted 17-22% net IRR represents a 300-500 basis point premium to public infrastructure REITs, justified by:
- Illiquidity premium for private markets exposure
- Value-add execution through repositioning and development
- First-mover advantage in emerging use categories
- Tactical timing at cycle inflection point

### Distressed Market Validation

Historical analysis shows distressed CRE funds raised during crisis periods delivered superior returns:

**Figure 13: Crisis Vintage Performance**

| **Crisis Period** | **Market Conditions** | **Distressed Fund Performance** |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **2002-2004** | Post dot-com, 9/11 impact | 15.7% median net IRR |
| **2008-2010** | Financial crisis | 18.3% median net IRR |
| **2020-2022** | COVID disruption | 14.2% median (still developing) |
| **2025-2027** | CRE credit unwind + AI demand | **Target: 17-22%** |

*Source: Preqin Private Real Estate Database*

Current market conditions suggest this vintage could exceed historical precedent due to:
- Technology integration creating new value categories
- ESG factors driving premium valuations
- Supply constraints in urban infill locations
