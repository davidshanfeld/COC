## I. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DISTRESS ACCELERATION

### Office Sector Deterioration Update (August 2025)

**Los Angeles Specific Metrics**:
- **County-wide Office Vacancy**: 24.5% (Q1 2025) ¹
- **Downtown LA Vacancy**: >31% (exceeding prior projections) ¹  
- **Average Sales Price Decline**: >60% since pandemic onset ²
- **Loan Maturities**: 20.1% of office loans maturing 2023-2025, affecting 59.3M SF ³

**CMBS Delinquency Crisis**:
- **Office CMBS Delinquency Rate**: Record high 11.08% (June 2025) ⁴
- **Previous Peak Comparison**: Surpassed December 2024 (11.01%) and July 2012 (10.70%) ⁴
- **Special Servicing Rate**: 16.19% - highest level in 25 years ⁵
- **Market Implication**: Growing inventory of distressed assets requiring intensive workout management

**Investment Validation**:
The accelerated distress validates Coastal Oak's strategy of acquiring below replacement cost during forced liquidation periods. Current market conditions exceed our base case stress assumptions, providing additional safety margin for acquisition targeting.

### Regional Bank Exposure Analysis

**National Banking Stress Indicators**:
- **Maturing Commercial Property Debt**: $2 trillion over next 3 years ⁶
- **US Banks vs. European Exposure**: US banks significantly more exposed to property stress ⁷
- **Refinancing Challenges**: Stricter lending requirements amid decreased property values ⁵

**Strategic Implications**:
Regional bank distress creates direct sourcing opportunities through special servicers and workout departments. Banks' need to clear troubled assets aligns with fund deployment timing.

## II. INFRASTRUCTURE DEMAND ACCELERATION

### California EV Charging Expansion (March 2025 Update)

**Infrastructure Deployment Metrics**:
- **Total EV Chargers**: 178,000+ (public and shared private) ⁸
- **Market Milestone**: 48% more EV chargers than gasoline nozzles statewide ⁸
- **Charger Type Breakdown**: 162,000+ Level 2 chargers, 17,000 fast chargers ⁸
- **Growth Rate**: 26,000+ new chargers added in 6 months (March 2025) ⁹

**Regulatory & Financial Support**:
- **Fast Charge California Project**: $55 million program, up to 100% installation cost coverage ¹⁰
- **Applications Open**: Through October 29, 2025 ¹⁰
- **CEC Investment Plan**: $1.4 billion approved (December 2024) for ZEV infrastructure ¹¹
- **Equity Requirement**: 50% of funds benefiting lower-income communities ¹¹

**Investment Validation**:
The 48% advantage over gasoline infrastructure validates our thesis that EV charging has reached mainstream infrastructure parity. Regulatory support reduces development risk and validates long-term demand assumptions.

### Data Center & AI Infrastructure Demand

**Federal Policy Support (January 2025)**:
- **Biden Executive Order**: Bolster energy resources for AI data centers ¹²
- **Government Site Access**: Federal sites available for AI data center development ¹²
- **Grid Connection Facilitation**: Streamlined utility interconnection processes ¹²
- **Clean Power Requirement**: Developers must ensure sufficient clean energy generation ¹²

**Market Demand Indicators**:
- **Data Center Vacancy**: Projected 2.8% (historic low) for 2025 ¹³
- **Construction Pipeline**: Record 4,750 MW under construction ¹³
- **Pre-lease Rate**: 90% for new facilities ¹³
- **Demand Driver**: AI workload requirements driving unprecedented capacity needs ¹³

**Strategic Validation**:
Federal executive action and record pre-leasing validate our focus on edge data center conversions. Government facilitation reduces permitting risk and validates power-first acquisition criteria.

**Data Center Investment Validation**:
- **Supply Constraint**: 2.8% vacancy rate indicates severe shortage ¹³
- **Pre-lease Security**: 90% pre-lease rate reduces leasing risk ¹³
- **Government Support**: Federal facilitation reduces development timeline risk ¹²
