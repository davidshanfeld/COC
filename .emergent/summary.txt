The previous AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a significant evolution of the product requirements. Initially, the task was broadly defined as a real-time data deck. This quickly refined into a highly specific 55-page investment prospectus for Coastal Oak Capital, demanding detailed content, structure, style adherence, and external data sourcing. The AI engineer diligently processed initial document uploads, confirming their receipt and starting analysis. However, a critical pivot occurred in the latest interaction: the user explicitly shifted the goal from a static document to a web application constantly updating itself in real-time. The AI engineer acknowledged this new scope, received additional supporting documents, and despite encountering a corrupted Excel file, proceeded to analyze the remaining PDFs. The work concludes with the AI engineer poised to formulate a detailed plan for this new real-time web application. No code changes have been applied to the existing codebase, which serves as the foundational environment.

<product_requirements>
The product requirement has evolved significantly. Initially, the goal was to build a well-refined, formatted deck with real-time data on commercial real estate opportunistic debt. This was then superseded by a detailed request for a 55-page investment prospectus for Coastal Oak Capital, a distressed and opportunistic real estate fund. This prospectus needed to be Word/Google Docs compatible, include a 19-section TOC, adhere to a Super Shanfeld voice, source real-time market data (CMBS trends, CLO exposure) from credible sources, cite statistics, and incorporate charts, tables, and maps with captions. The user provided fund-specific info, but AI was to source external data. Crucially, the *latest* explicit request from the user (Chat Message 25) re-scoped the project to a web application constantly updating itself in real-time to reflect current market data, suggesting sources like Fed data, CBRE, and CoStar public reports, and mentioning premium API keys.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had finished receiving crucial, *updated* input from the user. The initial objective to generate a static 55-page investment prospectus was completely superseded by a new request: to build a web application constantly updating itself in real-time to reflect current market data. The user specified potential data sources (Fed data, CBRE, CoStar public reports) and mentioned having premium API keys, though unsure of their applicability. In response, the user uploaded six additional document artifacts: , , , , , and . The AI engineer attempted to analyze these, noting that the  file was corrupted. However, successful extraction of information from several PDF documents, including Schroders Capital Investment Outlook and Global Data Center Outlook, was confirmed. The current state is that the AI engineer has processed the latest requirements and supporting documents and is preparing to formulate a comprehensive plan for developing the requested real-time web application. No code changes have been made to the initial React/FastAPI template.
