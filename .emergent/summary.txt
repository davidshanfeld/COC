The AI engineer successfully built the Coastal Oak Capital application from scratch, incorporating dual-password authentication, a legal disclaimer, role-based access, and a mock data dashboard with a specific teal theme and robust security. A critical missing feature, the investment prospectus (masterdeck), was subsequently integrated. This involved significant modifications to  to include a toggle for dashboard/prospectus views, a navigable sidebar for document sections (with mock content), and role-based download functionality (GPs can download, LPs view only). Backend stability was confirmed. The immediate pending task from this phase is to test the GP-specific download feature. Following this, the user introduced a new, substantial requirement: integrating institutional-level, polished Excel spreadsheets into the dashboard, featuring trackable cells, cited assumptions, real-time data, and case studies to explain market dynamics and investment rationale (WHAT-WHY-HOW narrative). The user is set to provide deliverables for this new feature.

<product_requirements>
The Coastal Oak Capital application aims to be an investment prospectus for a distressed real estate fund, requiring real-time data and high security. Initial requirements included: dual-password login (LP: view-only, GP: export), a multi-checkbox legal disclaimer/NDA gateway, a teal gradient design, and 24/7/365 mock data updates. The system implemented these, adding security features like disabling copy/paste and right-click. The masterdeck (investment prospectus) was then integrated into the dashboard, providing detailed sections with role-based viewing and GP-specific download.

A new, significant requirement involves displaying institutional-level Excel spreadsheets within the dashboard. These spreadsheets must feature fully trackable, cell-by-cell data, clearly stated and well-formatted assumptions, and ensure all figures are cited back to the prospectus for credibility. The Excel integration needs to include real-time, accurate data and incorporate case studies (like the pico blvd deal) to narrate the WHAT-WHY-HOW story of market dynamics and investment opportunities.

<code_architecture>


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application, handles MongoDB connection, defines Pydantic models, and exposes API endpoints prefixed with . It includes basic routes (, ), authentication endpoints (), and a  endpoint for real-time data.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  for LP and GP authentication using JWT. Added  to simulate real-time fund performance. Configured , , and . No new changes related to the masterdeck functionality were required in the backend, as the data for the masterdeck is currently mocked directly in the frontend.
    -   **Importance**: Central backend logic, responsible for user authentication, authorization, and serving dynamic market data.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component, managing client-side routing with . It orchestrates the flow from  to  and finally to  based on authentication state.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit modifications within the provided trajectory.
    -   **Importance**: Application entry point, defining the overall user flow and component rendering logic.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Implements the user login interface for both LP and GP, handling password input, authentication via backend API, and displaying toasts for feedback. It was initially an existing file with incorrect passwords and subtitle/button text.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated  to DigitalDepression and  to NicoleWest0904!!. Corrected the subtitle and login button text.
    -   **Importance**: The primary gateway for users to access the application, critical for security and initial user experience.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Presents a multi-checkbox legal disclaimer and NDA. Users must acknowledge all terms before proceeding to the dashboard.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created component, implementing the UI and logic for the disclaimer gateway.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures legal compliance and user agreement before accessing sensitive investment information.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Initially displayed mock real-time market data, fund performance, active portfolio, and market intelligence. It included conditional rendering for GP-specific export functionality and security features.
    -   **Changes Made**: Significantly modified to integrate a comprehensive masterdeck (investment prospectus) viewer. Added state management (, ) to toggle between dashboard and prospectus views. Implemented navigation buttons ( / ). Incorporated a left sidebar for navigating different prospectus sections (Executive Summary, Investment Strategy, Market Analysis, etc.). Added conditional rendering for GP-specific Download Prospectus button and Document download restricted to General Partners only message for LPs. The content for prospectus sections is mocked directly within this component.
    -   **Importance**: The core content area of the application; now displays both investment data and the full investment prospectus, enforcing role-based access and security.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains global CSS styles for the application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added styles for the teal gradient theme, aligning with the corporate logo. Included CSS rules to disable text selection, right-click, and keyboard shortcuts for enhanced security.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the initial development of the Coastal Oak Capital web application, making it fully functional and production-ready by addressing all core requirements: dual-password authentication (LP: , GP: ), a comprehensive 8-checkbox legal disclaimer/NDA gateway, role-based access control (LP: view-only, GP: full access including export), a real-time (mocked) dashboard, robust security features (disabling copy/paste, right-click, dev tools), and a professional teal gradient design.

However, the user reported a critical functional gap: the absence of the actual investment prospectus document (masterdeck). The AI engineer has just completed implementing this. The  component has been significantly refactored to include a toggle allowing users to switch between the original performance dashboard and a newly integrated Prospectus view. This prospectus view features a left-hand navigation sidebar with 8 distinct sections (e.g., Executive Summary, Investment Strategy, Risk Factors) containing mock content. Role-based access for the prospectus is in place: LPs see a message Document download restricted to General Partners only, while GPs are presented with a Download Prospectus button. Backend changes were confirmed to be non-breaking, and initial frontend screenshots confirm the successful display and navigation of the masterdeck for LPs, along with the correct display of the GP download restriction.
