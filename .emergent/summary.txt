The previous AI engineer successfully developed the Coastal Oak Capital application from its inception. Initial development focused on core features: a secure dual-password authentication system (LP/GP), a mandatory legal disclaimer, role-based access control, and a dashboard displaying mocked financial data with a specific teal theme. Security measures, like disabling text selection and right-click, were also implemented.

Subsequently, the masterdeck (investment prospectus) was integrated, which involved significant modifications to  to introduce view toggling, a navigable sidebar for prospectus sections, and role-based download functionality (GPs can download, LPs view only). The most recent development phase, now complete, involved integrating institutional-level Excel spreadsheets into . This required new data structures, a view toggle, export functionality for GPs, and rendering logic for Excel-like tables and case studies. The AI engineer is currently awaiting user verification for this Excel Reports feature and has provided login credentials for testing, and has just asked for a plan confirmation.

<product_requirements>
The Coastal Oak Capital application is an investment prospectus for a distressed real estate fund, requiring high security and real-time data. It features a dual-password login (LP: view-only, GP: export), a multi-checkbox legal disclaimer, a teal gradient design, and a dashboard with 24/7/365 mock data. Crucial security measures include disabling copy/paste and right-click. The masterdeck (investment prospectus) provides detailed sections with role-based viewing and GP-specific download. The latest feature requires displaying institutional-level Excel spreadsheets within the dashboard, with trackable, cell-by-cell data, formatted assumptions, and figures cited back to the prospectus. This integration must provide real-time, accurate data and incorporate case studies (e.g., pico blvd deal) explaining market dynamics using a WHAT-WHY-HOW narrative.

<pending_tasks>
-   Verify the functional behavior of the Excel Reports view, including its display, navigation, and especially the General Partner (GP) specific Excel data download functionality. This verification includes endpoint smoke tests, schema validation for , and UI walkthroughs for both LP and GP roles with screenshot capture.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation of the new requirement to integrate institutional-level Excel spreadsheets into the Coastal Oak Capital dashboard. This involved significant modifications to .

The work involved:
1.  **Data Structures**: Introducing  and  within  to hold mock data for Excel-like tables and narrative case studies (e.g., pico blvd deal).
2.  **View Toggling**: Adding a new state variable  and a corresponding navigation button to switch between Dashboard, Prospectus, and the new Excel Reports views.
3.  **Export Functionality**: Implementing a  function to manage the download of Excel reports, exclusively for General Partners, triggered by an Export Excel button.
4.  **Header Updates**: Dynamically updating the header subtitle to reflect the currently active view.
5.  **Component Rendering**: Adding a dedicated Excel Reports View section within 's JSX, which conditionally renders the mock Excel tables, assumptions, and case study narratives based on the  state.

The frontend implementation for the Excel Reports view is now functionally complete, with the content currently mocked. The AI engineer has requested user verification via a screenshot and has provided the necessary LP () and GP () passwords for testing. The current state is that the AI has just sent a plan to the user for confirmation before proceeding with the verification steps.
