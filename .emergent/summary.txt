The initial task was vaguely defined as a real-time data deck. This rapidly evolved into a specific, detailed request for a 55-page investment prospectus for Coastal Oak Capital. Initially, the AI engineer focused on document generation, requesting and analyzing multiple uploaded documents (e.g., master decks, research reports). A pivotal shift occurred when the user, in Chat Message 25 and 34, pivoted the core deliverable from a static prospectus document to a web application constantly updating itself in real-time, complete with sophisticated security requirements (LP login, GP export, disclaimers/NDA) and a specific design theme based on a provided logo. The AI engineer acknowledged these significant changes, confirming receipt of new documents and the logo, and formulated a high-level plan to implement the web application with all the new features. No code modifications have been made to the initial React/FastAPI/MongoDB boilerplate; the work so far has been entirely in understanding requirements and analyzing provided documents.

<product_requirements>
The project's objective is to develop a real-time web application, Coastal Oak Capital, serving as an investment prospectus for a distressed and opportunistic real estate fund. This application must constantly update itself with current market data, sourced from credible outlets like Fed data, CBRE, and CoStar public reports. It requires a sophisticated security layer: a universal password for Limited Partners (LPs) to access the site, and a special password for the General Partner (GP) enabling export functionality. Prior to full access, all users must acknowledge detailed legal disclaimers, warranties, and an NDA. LPs will have view-only access, unable to export, copy, paste, or screenshot. The application's design, including themes, colors, and fonts, must align with a provided corporate logo, featuring a teal gradient. The update frequency should be real-time (24/7/365).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Environment Configuration**: Standardized URLs, port mappings, and  prefix for backend.
-   **Shadcn UI Components**: Pre-built UI for consistent design.
-   **Real-time Data Integration**: Sourcing and continuous updating of financial market data.
-   **Authentication & Authorization**: Universal LP login and special GP export password with access controls.
-   **Document/Content Processing**: Analysis of uploaded documents for content generation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The codebase is structured as a full-stack application within the  directory, comprising a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, designed to interact with a MongoDB database.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the core FastAPI application file, responsible for setting up MongoDB connection, defining Pydantic models, and exposing API endpoints prefixed with . It includes basic routes like  (returning Hello World) and . CORS middleware and logging are also configured.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit modifications have been made to this file within the provided trajectory.
    -   **Importance**: Acts as the central backend logic and API server, crucial for handling data and requests from the frontend, adhering to Kubernetes ingress rules.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component, managing client-side routing with . It features a  component that performs an  request to the backend's  endpoint, demonstrating initial frontend-backend communication.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit modifications have been made to this file within the provided trajectory.
    -   **Importance**: Serves as the application's entry point, defining the overall structure and demonstrating basic connectivity.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This directory contains a comprehensive set of pre-built Shadcn UI components (e.g., , , , ). These components are designed for reusability, accessibility, and consistent styling.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit modifications have been made to these files within the provided trajectory.
    -   **Importance**: Provides foundational UI elements for rapid development and ensures a cohesive and modern design as per the system's guidelines.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A custom React hook designed for managing and displaying transient toast notifications to the user. It encapsulates logic for adding, updating, dismissing, and removing toasts, including limits and delays.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit modifications have been made to this file within the provided trajectory.
    -   **Importance**: Offers a standardized and centralized mechanism for providing user feedback through non-intrusive notifications.

-   **Other files (, , , , , )**: These files configure environment variables, backend dependencies, frontend dependencies, global and component-specific CSS, and Tailwind CSS. They represent a stable initial setup with no changes within the trajectory.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer has completed the initial phase of requirement gathering and document analysis. The project scope significantly evolved from a static prospectus document to a dynamic, real-time web application. The user has provided an extensive set of documents, including initial master decks, research outlooks (e.g., Schroders Capital Investment Outlook, global data center outlook), and a crucial corporate logo (). The AI engineer has confirmed receipt and attempted to analyze all these documents, noting a potential corruption in . The latest user input (Chat Message 34) introduced critical new requirements: a secure LP login with a universal password, a special GP password for export functionality, a mandatory legal disclaimer/NDA acknowledgment before access, real-time data updates (24/7/365), and a design theme derived from the provided logo. The AI engineer has acknowledged these requirements and outlined a high-level plan for implementation, ready to commence development on these features. No code changes have been applied to the existing React/FastAPI codebase yet.
