The trajectory outlines the initial setup of a React, FastAPI, and MongoDB full-stack application, complete with environmental configurations, development workflows, and strict design guidelines. Initially, the task was vaguely described as building a real-time data deck. However, the conversation rapidly shifted. The user subsequently provided a detailed, comprehensive requirement to generate a 55-page investment prospectus for Coastal Oak Capital, specifying structure, style, and content, and explicitly stating that external data must be sourced by the AI. Five document artifacts were uploaded. The AI engineer acknowledged these uploads. The core shift is from general app development to a highly specific document generation task, with the provided codebase serving as the environment but not yet undergoing specific modifications relevant to the prospectus. The AI engineer is currently poised to begin processing the provided documents and external data for prospectus creation.

<product_requirements>
The initial product requirement was to build a well-refined, formatted deck with real-time data on commercial real estate opportunistic debt for an investment piece. This was significantly updated in Chat Message 5. The current, explicit product requirement is to draft a fully finalized, 55-page investment prospectus for Coastal Oak Capital, a distressed and opportunistic real estate fund. This prospectus must be in a Microsoft Word/Google Docs-compatible format, include a detailed 19-section table of contents, and adhere to a Super Shanfeld voice (radical authenticity, surgical precision, clear macro framing, unapologetic conviction, executive tone, minimal dry humor). It requires sourcing real-time market data (e.g., CMBS trends, CLO exposure) from credible sources, citing all statistics, and incorporating charts, tables, and maps with captions. The document should reflect institutional-level polish and be an LP-facing pitchbook. The user will provide fund-specific information, strategy, team bios, and case studies, but external market data must be sourced and integrated by the AI.

<code_architecture>
The codebase is structured as a full-stack application within the  directory, comprising a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, designed to interact with a MongoDB database.



- ****:
    - **Summary**: This is the core FastAPI application file. It establishes the MongoDB connection, defines Pydantic models (, ), sets up an  with the  prefix, and includes basic endpoints for  (returning Hello World) and  (for creating and retrieving status checks). It configures CORS middleware and logging.
    - **Changes Made**: No modifications have been made to this file within the provided trajectory.
    - **Importance**: It's the central hub for backend logic and API exposure, adhering to the specified  prefix rule for Kubernetes ingress.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: The main React component that sets up the client-side routing using . It includes a  component that makes an  call to the backend's  endpoint to log a Hello World message.
    - **Changes Made**: No modifications have been made to this file within the provided trajectory.
    - **Importance**: Serves as the application's entry point, demonstrating frontend-backend communication and setting up the basic single-page application structure.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: This directory contains a comprehensive set of pre-built Shadcn UI components (e.g., , , , ). These are ready-to-use, accessible, and stylable React components.
    - **Changes Made**: No modifications have been made to these files within the provided trajectory.
    - **Importance**: Provides the foundational building blocks for the frontend UI, ensuring consistent design and adherence to modern best practices as per the system prompt's design guidelines.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: A custom React hook for managing and displaying transient toast notifications. It includes logic for adding, updating, dismissing, and removing toasts, with a  and .
    - **Changes Made**: No modifications have been made to this file within the provided trajectory.
    - **Importance**: Offers a reusable and standardized way to provide user feedback through notifications without directly interacting with the DOM.

- **Other files (, , , , , )**: These configuration and styling files define the environment variables, backend dependencies, frontend dependencies, global and component-specific CSS, and Tailwind CSS configuration respectively. No changes have been made to these within the trajectory, indicating a stable initial setup.

<pending_tasks>
- Analyze the 5 uploaded documents provided by the user for the Coastal Oak Capital prospectus.
- Begin outlining and drafting the 55-page investment prospectus according to the detailed structure and style guidelines.
- Source real-time market data, valuation comparables, CMBS trends, CLO exposure stats, macro outlooks, and regulation summaries from credible external sources.
- Integrate charts, tables, and maps with appropriate captions into the prospectus.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had finished receiving critical input from the user. The initial broad  to build a deck with real-time data on commercial real estate opportunistic debt has been completely superseded by a highly detailed request to generate a 55-page investment prospectus for Coastal Oak Capital. The user provided an extensive prompt in Chat Message 5, outlining the objective, what information they would provide versus what the AI should source (e.g., live market data, valuation comparables), required deliverable format (Microsoft Word/Google Docs compatible, 55 pages, detailed TOC, charts, tables, maps, citations), and a specific Super Shanfeld voice style guide. Crucially, the user also uploaded five document artifacts: , , , , and . The AI engineer confirmed the receipt of these documents in Chat Message 7. Therefore, the current state of work is that the AI has the full requirements and initial reference materials for the prospectus generation and is ready to commence content creation. No code changes have been made to the initial full-stack application template.
